;; # Intro to Linear Algebra - DRAFT ðŸ› 

;; In this tutorial, we introduce basic linear algebra concepts
;; and the way they can be computed using [Fastmath](https://github.com/generateme/fastmath).

;; For additional backgrounds, see
;; [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra â€“ Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/)
