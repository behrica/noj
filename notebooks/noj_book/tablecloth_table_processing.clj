;; # Table processing with Tablecloth

;; author: Daniel Slutsky

;; last change: 2024-11-25


;; [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) 
;; is a table processing library
;; inspired by the dataframe ergonomics typicall to the [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
;; ecosystem, specifically the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/),
;; but offers certain advantages on top of that.

;; It is built on top of the data structures
;; and functions of [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset),
;; a high-performance table processing library, but adds its own 
;; concepts and functionality.

;; In this tutorial, we will see a few of the core ideas of Tablecloth.
;; You are encouraget to look into [the main documentation](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/)
;; for more information.

;; ## Setup

;; We create a namespace and require the Tablecloth API namespaces:
;; The main API `tablecloth.api`
;; and the Column API `tablecloth.column.api` that we'll see below.

(ns noj-book.tablecloth-table-processing 
  (:require [tablecloth.api :as tc]
            [tablecloth.column.api :as tcc]))

;; ## About this tutorial

;; In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the ergonomics of so-called dataset
;; datastrucutes provided by Tablecloth.

;; A lot of what we demonstrate can also be implemented with the
;; classical Clojure data strucures: vectors and maps.
;; Datasets are table-like data structures, often  called data-frames
;; in other data science platforms. They provide not only performance
;; advantages in space and time, but also certain usability features,
;; which are arguably expressive and powerful.

;; We will oftwen use [treading macros](https://clojure.org/guides/threading_macros),
;; mostly [`->`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/-%3E).
;; This approach is compatible with data science cultures such as
;; the one of the Tidyverse in R.

;; ## Creating a dataset

;; Assume we have a vector of vectors representing bike trips.
;; Each trip has a type of bike and the coordinates of its start and end.
;; We can turn this data structure into a dataset:

(tc/dataset [["classic_bike" 41.906866 -87.626217 41.92393131136619 -87.63582453131676]
             ["electric_bike" 41.869312286 -87.673897266 41.8895 -87.688257]
             ["classic_bike" 41.95600355078549 -87.68016144633293 41.886875 -87.62603]]
            {:column-names [:rideable-type
                            :start-lat :start-lng
                            :end-lat :end-lng]})


;; Sometimes, data may arrive in different shapes.
;; We can also create such a dataset from a vector of maps:

(tc/dataset [{:rideable-type "classic_bike"
              :start-lat     41.906866
              :start-lng     -87.626217
              :end-lat       41.92393131136619
              :end-lng       -87.63582453131676}
             {:rideable-type "electric_bike"
              :start-lat     41.869312286
              :start-lng     -87.673897266
              :end-lat       41.8895
              :end-lng       -87.688257 }
             {:rideable-type "classic_bike"
              :start-lat     41.95600355078549
              :start-lng     -87.68016144633293
              :end-lat       41.886875
              :end-lng       -87.62603}])

;; .. and also, from a map of vectors:

(tc/dataset {:rideable-type ["classic_bike" "electric_bike" "classic_bike"]
             :start-lat     [41.906866 41.869312286 41.95600355078549]
             :start-lng     [-87.626217 -87.673897266 -87.68016144633293]
             :end-lat       [41.92393131136619 41.8895 41.886875]
             :end-lng       [-87.63582453131676 -87.688257 -87.62603]})


;; ## What is a dataset?

;; Let us explore this data structure, our little dataset of bike trips.

(def some-trips
  (tc/dataset {:rideable-type ["classic_bike" "electric_bike" "classic_bike"]
               :start-lat     [41.906866 41.869312286 41.95600355078549]
               :start-lng     [-87.626217 -87.673897266 -87.68016144633293]
               :end-lat       [41.92393131136619 41.8895 41.886875]
               :end-lng       [-87.63582453131676 -87.688257 -87.62603]}))

some-trips

;; A dataset is a value of `Dataset` datatype defined in the tech.ml.dataset library:

(type some-trips)

;; One thing worth knowing about this datatype is that it is extended by
;; quite a few interfaces and protocos.

;; For example, it behaves as a map.

(map? some-trips)

;; The keys are the column names:

(keys some-trips)

;; .. and the values are the columns:

(:start-lat some-trips)

;; Now we need to discuss what columns are.

;; ## What is a column?

(:start-lat some-trips)

;; A column is a value of `Dataset` datatype defined in the tech.ml.dataset library:

(-> some-trips
    :start-lat
    type)

;; This datatype is also extended by quite a few interfaces and protocols.

;; For example, it is sequential.

(-> some-trips
    :start-lat
    sequential?)

;; So, we can use the sequence abstraction with it:

(->> (:start-lat some-trips)
     (take 2))

(->> (:rideable-type some-trips)
     (filter #{"classic_bike"}))

;; It is also assiciative:

(-> some-trips
    :rideable-type
     (assoc 2 "my strange and unique bike"))

;; ## Working with Columns

;; We may use Tablecloth's Column API to create and process columns.
;; For example:

(tcc/column ["classic_bike" "electrical_bike" "classic_bike"])

;; What is the average latitude where trips tend to start?
(-> some-trips
    :start-lat
    tcc/mean)

;; What is the type of elements in this Column?
(-> some-trips
    :start-lat
    tcc/typeof)

;; Let us look into our latitudes in radians:
(-> some-trips
    :start-lat
    (tcc/* (/ Math/PI 180)))

;; You see, columns are typed, and this has implications for both
;; for both performance (time and space) and ergonomics.

;; ## The data in columns

;; You will probably not need this detail most times, but it is worth knowing
;; that the data actually held by the Column can be accessed as the `.data` field,
;; and it can be of varying data structures.

;; For example:

(-> some-trips
    :start-lat 
    .data
    type)

(-> some-trips
    :rideable-type
    .data
     type)

(-> (range 9)
    tcc/column
    .data
    type)

;; Behind the scenes, tech.ml.dataset makes sure to use efficient data structures
;; for columns, so that, e.g., random access by index will be efficient:

(-> some-trips
    :start-lat
    (nth 2))

;; The following is quick!
(-> (range 1000000) 
    (tcc/* 1000) 
    (nth 10000)) 

;; That is thanks to the "lazy and noncaching" 
;; semantics of the undelying [dtype-next](https://github.com/cnuernber/dtype-next) library,
;; which is a topic worth its own tutorial.

;; ## Reading datasets

;; Datasets are oftewn read from files.

;; Let us read a file from the 
;; [Chicago bike trips](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/godofoutcasts/cyclistic-bike-share-2023) dataset.
;; In this case, it is a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file 
;; compressed by [gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip), but other formats are supported as well.

(def trips
  (tc/dataset "data/chicago-bikes/202304_divvy_tripdata.csv.gz"
              {:key-fn keyword}))
