# Noj
![Noj logo](notebooks/Noj.svg)

Noj gets you started with Clojure for data and science.
* You get a collection of good libraries out of the box
* .. and documentation that shows you how to use the different libraries together

The included libraries either use [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset) directly as tabular data structure or provide high interoperability with it.

## Status
Most of the [underlying libraries](https://scicloj.github.io/noj/noj_book.underlying_libraries.html) are stable. The experimental parts are marked as such. For some of the libraries, we use a branch for an upcoming release.
The main current goal is to provide a clear picture of the direction the stack is going towards, expecting most of it to stabilize around October 2024.
